A reference based subtitle quality assessment model is a model developed to assess the quality of machine made subtitles by cross referencing with human made subtitles of the same subject.
The models return a score, usually between 0 and 1 (with 2 decimals, e.g 0.50), where 1 is the highest of quality and 0 is the lowest. 

The different models use different metrics in order to assess quality and are therefor not comparable by the score returned by the models. Some are also made for a specific use case, e.g interlingual or live subtitles.
