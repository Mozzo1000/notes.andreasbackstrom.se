# Discovery
First we need to find the websites to index. To do so we will use two separate methods as our input, sitemap and crawling for links.
## Inputs
### Sitemap
Websites that provide a `sitemap.xml` file will have a already compiled list of links with (sometimes) accompanying information.
### Crawling links
When there are no sitemap provided we have to crawl and follow links that are visible on the web pages. Starting from a url, we will look for other links, collect information along the way and load in the next url

## Data points
The data points that we are interested in collecting,
- url
- title
- description
- date added
- date last updated
