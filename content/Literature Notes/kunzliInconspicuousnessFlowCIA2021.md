> [!Abstract]
>
> Professional subtitlers’ perceptions of quality were studied in an online survey conducted in three German-speaking countries. Fifty-nine subtitlers filled in a questionnaire that contained items on quality parameters and quality assurance measures. The respondents’ quality statements were categorised into three overall quality dimensions – correspondence between original and subtitles, intelligibility, and linguistic authenticity – each with its own subset of quality parameters. This was the basis for the construction of the CIA model of interlingual subtitle quality. It is hypothesised that if the model’s quality dimensions and parameters are met, subtitle reception will lead to a flow experience. Suggestions for future directions concern time-lag studies to investigate how quality perceptions evolve over time, research into subtitling competence, and testing of the validity of the model by having professional subtitlers assess a set of subtitles while thinking aloud.

# Notes
>
>The model proposed in this paper has not been used in any real world examples or compared to other models like BLEAU or WER.
>
>The model has a strong focus on interlingual subtitling but the core ideas and structure would be good to use in other work, including intralingual subtitling.
>
>Determining subtitle quality can depend on several factors including,
>1. Audiovisual genre - i.e documentary, comedy.
>2. The medium - is the video being watched on a movie screen, at home or on a smartphone?
>3. Audience - age of the viewer, cultural background, educational background, sensory impairments etc.
>4. The reason for the media - has the video been made to entertain or educate the viewer?
> 
>These factors will change the way the subtitle will be made. A correctly made subtitle for a documentary will have a different styling and use different words than one made for comedy purposes where culture may prominent in the delivery of the jokes. These subtitles may still be considered correct despite there differences..

>Font and positioning of subtitles are not as big of a problem with closed captioning as the viewer can choose these themselves.
Speed will still be a problem with closed captions.



<mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 204, 0, 0.212);">Quote 6: The subtitles disappear. They are so perfectly integrated with the footage that you hardly notice them. Quote 7: Good subtitles are almost imperceptible, because they follow the rhythm of the film without imposing themselves. Quote 8: All roles or characters in the film are presented so convincingly, even with the limited means of subtitling, that the viewer can identify with them.</mark>

>Good subtitles does not get noticed instead the blend in with the viewers experience of the movie.
