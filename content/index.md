Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Andreas BackstrÃ¶m](https://andreasbackstrom.se) and this is my place for all the notes I take on the many different topics that interest me and ideas that pop up in my head.

The notes are ever-changing and are written in a way that might be considered messy and unpolished. They are written mainly for myself but shared on the internet for anyone that may want to read and learn along side me.

> The notes on this site may be written in either English or Swedish depending on the context in which I am taking them in.
