A Culture Hack is an activity that changes the working culture at a company for the better.

Culture Hacks should be,
**Actionable**
- a task or something that you easily can understand and do
**Low effort**
- should not require a several months long projects to complete. Instead require as little effort as possible.
**Immediate**
- should be something that can be worked on immediately. tasks can be done in steps so start right away with informing and working on it.
**Visible**
- the activity should be visible within your organization, not something done behind closed doors. 
**Emotional**
- the result should make the target audience (your organization) understand by feeling. By getting emotional about an issue the chances for engagement rises.

Examples of culture hack activities at *REDACTED*

- Develop an information pack to help teams travel more sustainable
